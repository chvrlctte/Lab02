        <h3><strong>Process:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the skillet over medium heat
            </li>
            <li>
                Butter one side of each slice of bread
            </li>
            <li>
                Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet
            </li>
            <li>
                Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>
                Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h4>Note:</h4>
     <p>
        Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.
